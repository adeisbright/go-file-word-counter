# GO FILE WORD COUNTER 

Go File Word Counter takes the name of a file from the command line, read the content of the file, and then count how many times a particular word occurs in that file. 

To be able to work this, the program uses the following: 

- Command Line Reading and Parsing 

- IO File Operations 

- Error Handling 

- Packages and Modules 

- Strings 

## Get Started 
Ensure you have Go running on the machine that will be running the code. 

Clone this repo, and launch the program using : 

```
go run main.go {{fileName}}
```

Where {{fileName}} is the name of the file that you are interested in reading
